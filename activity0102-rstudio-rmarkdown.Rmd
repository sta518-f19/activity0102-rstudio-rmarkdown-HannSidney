### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```


### Exercise 1

Datasaurus has 1846 rows and 3 columns.

### Exercise 2

Plot of the data in the dino dataset:

```{r plot-dino, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()

```

Calculating the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

```{r cor-dino}
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

The data plot looks like a T-rex

### Exercise 3

Creating the plot for the star dataset

```{r plot-star}
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")

ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

Calculating the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

```{r cor-star}
star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

The r value of this data set is very similar to the r value for dino. The coefficients are .015 away from each other and show almost zero correlation.

### Exercise 4

Creating the plot for the circle dataset

```{r plot-circle}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")

ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

Calculating the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

```{r cor-circle}
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

The r value of this data set is very similar to the r value for dino. The coefficients are .015 away from each other and show almost zero correlation.

### Exercise 5

(Add code and narrative as needed. To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.)
